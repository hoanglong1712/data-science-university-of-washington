Course Description
Survey course introducing the essential elements of data science: data collection, management, cu-
ration, and cleaning; summarizing and visualizing data; basic ideas of statistical inference, machine
learning. Students will gain hands-on experience through computing labs. The course will focus on
the R statistical computing language.

Course Materials
• Optional Textbooks:
– The Foundations of Data Science by Ani Adhikari and John DeNero.
– R for Data Science by Wickham Grolemund.
– Open Intro Statistics, 4th ed.: Diez, D.M.; Cetinkaya-Rundel, M.; Barr, C.D. A free pdf
copy of the book can be found here.

• Laptop: All students are encouraged to install R and R Studio on their personal devices. R
is a free software that is available for many platforms. Please contact UW Student Technology
Loan Program (https://stlp.uw.edu) if you do not have a reliable personal laptop.

PA STAT 180: Introduction to Data Science
Course Objectives
At the end of this course, students should be able to:
• Identify limitations in data collection methods and explain how this limits the scope of inference.
• Summarize patterns in data visually and analyze data to understand natural phenomena, in-
vestigate patterns, model outcomes, and make predictions, and effective communication of
results.
• Use statistical software for graphical and numerical summaries, various forms of inference, and
make data-based decisions. Master the use of the R and RStudio interactive environment.
Course Structure
The course is organized into six units:
1. Introduction to R and RStudio
2. Introduction to Data, Data Types, and Data Science
3. Data Exploration and Cleaning
4. Summarizing and Visualizing Data
5. Foundations of Statistical Inference
6. Introduction to Machine Learning
Each unit will be covered over the course of a week, with some units taking more time. Roughly
speaking, Tuesday/Thursday classes will involve presentation of new material, and guided problem
solving. Friday quiz section held by the TA will invo
